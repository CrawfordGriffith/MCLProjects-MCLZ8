This is my subtree fork of @MicroCoreLabs/Projects/MCLZ8 (Z80 In-Circuit Emulator)

Subtree forks mean you do not have to clone the entire @MicroCoreLabs/Projects folder

This fork has some cleanup and tweaks to make the code more general

First, I'm moving the code into subfolders so the Arduino IDE does not do this

Second, I am moving the compile parameters (Optimization level, CPU speed) into code

Next, I'm making the generic code more general by conditional compilation of systm specific deails

Then I will be adding some of my on ideas
